        Better engineering through management – the surprising benefits of becoming a manager

        One of our core values at Intercom is “We love people who genuinely want to learn and grow.”</p>
      <p>Of course, celebrating and encouraging a growth mindset is all good and well, but how do we put in place
        structures and processes that actually encourage career growth?</p>
      <p> In the Engineering org, we’ve thought deeply about how to foster long-term growth opportunities for people.
        Like some companies, our progression track for engineers splits in two after senior engineer – either continuing
        as an IC at staff or principal levels, or taking a turn into people management.</p>

        <p>Negative emotions can stunt learning. Imagine how your customers are feeling when they land on your help
          center. Maybe they’re confused about how a feature works, frustrated that they can’t figure out a particular
          problem or hungry to learn more about your product. Few companies take the time to anticipate and address the
          real frustrations customers experience. When you reach out to ease your customers’ concerns, it helps instill
          an
          upbeat attitude, which in turn inspires learning.</p>

          <h2>4. Do that instead</h2>
          <p>It’s no good writing a great help article your customers can’t find. They’ll soon grow frustrated and give up searching.</p>
          <p>Instead, pay attention to the words your customers use to ask for help with your product, whether it’s on Google or in your help center. Do some keyword research to find the phrases they’re using to find your content.</p>
          <p>Work those keywords into your:</p>

          <ol>
              <li>Article title. Clear, action-based titles work best, such as “Collaborate together on projects”. Short titles will also perform better when it comes to SEO. If you’re using Intercom Articles, once you publish your article, the collection it belongs to and the section it’s in will also appear in the URL.</li>
              <li>Article description. This should clearly define what the article contains and how it can help. Keep it short and to the point (aim for no more than 140 characters).</li>
              <li>Link text. Writing link text that says “click here” or “find out more” is a wasted opportunity. When linking to related articles, include keywords customers are likely to search for, like in this example: “Here’s how to improve articles that get negative reactions based on rich customer data.”</li>
          </ol>
